Tun Works of John ol Salisbury have never
before been collected together, nor have they
ever until now, either wholly or in part, been Ι

printed in this country. Yet the writer was
without doubt superior to all his contempo-
rarieS, and his Works are by far the most
valuable compositions which have come down
to ηε, from the twellth and thirteenth cen·
turies.

John, sumamed of Salisbury, perhaps from
the place of his birth, must have been born
about the year 1120, for he says somewhere
in his Works that he was admodum adolescens
in 1136. Some have supposed from apassage⁸‚
where he calls himself Porcus, that his real
surname was Petit, or Small, hut the passage
